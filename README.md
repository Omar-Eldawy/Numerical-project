# Numerical Analysis 
This project deals with how to use computers to solve some of the main important things related to math field -with controllability over machine precision (number of significant figures)- like
- Solving equations.
- Finding roots.
- Drawing functions.
## Main Algorithms used
### For solving system of linear equations
1. Gauss Elimination.
2. Gauss Jordan.
3. LU Decomposition.
4. Gauss Seidel.
5. Jacobi Iteration.
### For calculating the roots of equations
1. Bisection
2. False-Position
3. Fixed point
4. Original Newton-Raphson
5. Modified Newton-Raphson
6. Secant Method.
